# smart-dustbin

Developed a Smart Dustbin using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and a servo motor to enable automatic lid opening and closing. The system detects a user's hand approaching the bin and opens the lid using a servo motor, reducing the need for physical contact and promoting hygiene. The dustbin also integrates an LCD display to show fill levels and can send notifications when it reaches capacity.
